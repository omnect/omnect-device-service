# demo-portal-module

## Instruction
This module is based on the ICS_DeviceManagement [iot-client-template-rs](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/iot-client-template-rs). All information you need to build the project can be found there.


## What is demo-portal-module
This module on the device side is designed to **demonstrate** the  workflows:
- factory reset
- iot-hub-device-update user consent

### Factory reset
The module itself does not perform a factory reset.
It serves as an interface between the cloud and the built-in factory reset from the [ics-dm yocto image](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/meta-ics-dm).

A function was specified for this purpose, a so-called direct method which is described below.

**Direct method: factory reset**

Method Name:

**factory**

Payload:
```
{
  "reset":"<factory reset type>"
}
```

Result:
{"status": <HTTP-Statusode>,"payload":"<result>"}


The supported "factory reset type" and the documentation in general about the factory reset can be found in the [meta-ics-dm layer](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/meta-ics-dm#factory-reset).

In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{"status":200,"payload":"Ok"}
```

In all other cases there will be a meaningful error message in the status and payload.

Performing a factory reset also triggers a device restart. The restart time of a device depends on the selected factory reset. After the device has been restarted, this module sends a confirmation to the cloud as reported property in the module twin.

```
"factory_reset_status": {
    "date": "<UTC time of the factory reset status>",
    "status": "<status>"
}
```

The following status information is defined:
 - "in_progress"
 - "succeeded"
 - "failed"
 - "unexpected factory reset type"


### iot-hub-device-update user consent

In our systems we use the service [iot-hub-device-update](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update) for device firmware update. We have extended this service to include a "user consent" functionality, which allows the user to individually approve a new device update for his IoT device.

The module itself does not perform a user consent. It serves as an interface between the cloud and the built-in user consent from the [ics-dm yocto image](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/meta-ics-dm).

#### Configure general consent

To enable a general consent for all swupdate based firmware updates configure the following general_consent setting in the module twin:

```
"general_consent":
[
  "swupdate"
]
```

To disable the general consent enter the following setting in the module twin:

```
"general_consent":
[

]
```

The current general consent status is also exposed to he cloud as reported property.

#### User consent
If there is no general approval for a firmware update, a separate approval must be given for each upcoming update.
A direct method was specified for this purpose which is described below.

**Direct method: user_consent**

Method Name:

**user_consent**

Payload:
```
{
  "swupdate":"<version>"
}
```

Result:
{"status": <HTTP-Statusode>,"payload":"<result>"}

In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{"status":200,"payload":"Ok"}
```

In all other cases there will be a meaningful error message in the status and payload.

#### Status user consent

The module reports the status for a required user consent. The module sends for this purpose a request to the cloud as reported property in the module twin.

```
"user_consent_request":{
  "swupdate":"<version>"
}
```

As soon as the consent for a new update has been granted via the direct method "user_consent", this status is reported via the user_consent_history reported property in the module twin.

```
"user_consent_history":{
  "swupdate":[
    "<version>"
  ]
}
```
