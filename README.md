## Configuration

### Log level

Use `RUST_LOG` environment variable in order to configure log level as described [here](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging).

### azure-iot-sdk

Runtime configuration options of the underlying azure-iot-sdk crate can be found [here](https://github.com/omnect/azure-iot-sdk/blob/main/README.md).

## Azure twin features

### Factory reset
The module itself does not perform a factory reset.
It serves as an interface between the cloud and the built-in factory reset from the [omnect yocto image](https://github.com/omnect/meta-omnect).

#### Feature availability

The availability of the feature is reported by the following module twin property:
```
"factory_reset":
{
  "version": <ver>
}
```

The availability of the feature might be suppressed by creating the following environment variable:
```
SUPPRESS_FACTORY_RESET=true
```

#### Trigger factory reset

**Direct method: factory reset**

Method Name: `factory_reset`

Payload:
```
{
  "type": <factory reset type number>,
  "restore_settings":
  [
      "wifi"
  ]
}
```

Result:
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statusode>,
  "payload": {"<result>"}
}


The supported reset `type` and the documentation in general can be found in the [meta-omnect layer](https://github.com/omnect/meta-omnect#factory-reset).

The **optional** `restore_settings` array can be used to define user settings that must be restored after wiping device storage. Currently only `wifi` settings in `wpa_supplicant.conf` can be restored.

In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status and a meaningful message in the payload:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {"error message"}
}
```

#### Report factory reset status

Performing a factory reset also triggers a device restart. The restart time of a device depends on the selected factory reset. After the device has been restarted, this module sends a confirmation to the cloud as reported property in the module twin.

```
"factory_reset":
{
  "status":
  {
      "date": "<UTC time of the factory reset status>",
      "status": "<status>"
  }
}
```

The following status information is defined:
 - "in_progress"
 - "succeeded"
 - "failed"
 - "unexpected factory reset type"


### iot-hub-device-update user consent

omnect os uses [iot-hub-device-update](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update) service for device firmware update. The service is extended by a "user consent" [content handler](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/blob/main/docs/agent-reference/how-to-implement-custom-update-handler.md), which allows the user to individually approve a new device update for his IoT device.

The module itself does not perform a user consent. It serves as an interface between the cloud and the content handler in [omnect yocto image](https://github.com/omnect/meta-omnect).

Adapt the following environment variable in order to configure the directory used for consent files at runtime:
```
# use the following directory for consent files (defaults to "/etc/omnect/consent"), e.g.:
CONSENT_DIR_PATH: "/my/path"
```

#### Feature availability

The availability of the feature is reported by the following module twin property:
```
"device_update_consent":
{
  "version": <ver>
}
```

The availability of the feature might be suppressed by creating the following environment variable:
```
SUPPRESS_DEVICE_UPDATE_USER_CONSENT=true
```

#### Configure current desired general consent

To enable a general consent for all swupdate based firmware updates, configure the following general_consent setting in the module twin (the setting is case insensitive):

```
"general_consent":
[
  "swupdate"
]
```

To disable the general consent enter the following setting in the module twin:

```
"general_consent":
[

]
```

The current general consent status is also exposed to the cloud as reported property. In case no desired general_consent is defined the current general_consent settings of the device are reported.

#### Grant user consent

If there is no general approval for a firmware update, a separate approval must be given for each upcoming update.
A direct method was specified for this purpose which is described below.

**Direct method: user_consent**

Method Name: `user_consent`

Payload:
```
{
  "swupdate": "<version>"
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statusode>,
  "payload": {"<result>"}
}
```

In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status and a meaningful message in the payload:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {"error message"}
}
```

#### Current reported user consent status

The module reports the status for a required user consent. For this purpose the module sends a reported property to the cloud.

```
"device_update_consent":
{
  "user_consent_request": [
      {
          "swupdate": "<version>"
      }
  ]
}
```

As soon as the consent for a new update has been granted via the direct method "user_consent", this status is reported via the user_consent_history reported property in the module twin.

```
"device_update_consent":
{
  "user_consent_history":
  {
    "swupdate":
    [
      "<version>"
    ]
  }
}
```

### provisioning configuration

omnect-os uses the [azure iot-identity-service](https://github.com/Azure/iot-identity-service) to provision the device.

#### Feature availability

The availability of the feature is reported by the following module twin property:
```
"provisioning_config":
{
  "version": <ver>
}
```

The availability of the feature might be suppressed by creating the following environment variable:
```
SUPPRESS_PROVISIONING_CONFIG=true
```

#### Current reported provisioning configuration

The module reports the current provisioning configuration status. For this purpose the module sends a reported property to the cloud.

non-x509 method:
```
"provisioning-config": {
  "source": string("dps" | "manual")
  "method": string("tpm", "sas", "symmetric_key")
}
```
x509 method:
```
"provisioning_config":{
  "source": string("dps" | "manual"),
  "method": {
    "x509": {
      "expires": string(datetime) // e.g. "2024-06-21T07:12:30Z"
      "est": bool,
    }
  }
}
```

### Reboot

#### Feature availability

The availability of the feature is reported by the following module twin property:
```
"reboot":
{
  "version": <ver>
}
```

The availability of the feature might be suppressed by creating the following environment variable:
```
SUPPRESS_REBOOT=true
```

#### Trigger reboot

A direct method to trigger a device reboot.

**Direct method: reboot**

Method Name: `reboot`

Payload:
```
{
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statusode>,
  "payload": {}
}
```
In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {}
}
```

#### Configure wait-online reboot timeout

There is a configurable timeout the device waits for a network connection. Further information about used network interfaces and configuration options can be found in [meta-omnect: modify-set-of-interfaces-considered-when-detecting-online-state](https://github.com/omnect/meta-omnect?tab=readme-ov-file#modify-set-of-interfaces-considered-when-detecting-online-state).

**Direct method: set_wait_online_timeout**

Method Name: `set_wait_online_timeout`

Payload:<br>
The timeout is defined in seconds. A "timeout_secs" value of 0 means no timeout. An empty payload also means no timeout to be set at all.
```
{
  "timeout_secs": <secs>
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statusode>,
  "payload": {}
}
```

    },
    {
      "addr_v6": [
        "fe80::4c8e:77ff:fec1:10d3"
      ],
      "mac": "4e:8e:77:c1:10:d3",
      "name": "vethbd467ae"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Refresh Network status

A direct method to refresh and report current network status.

**Direct method: refresh_network_status**

Method Name: `refresh_network_status`

Payload:
```
{
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statusode>,
  "payload": {}
}
```
In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {}
}
```

### SSH Tunnel handling

#### Feature availability

The availability of the feature is reported by the following module twin property:
```
"ssh_tunnel":
{
  "version": <ver>
}
```

The availability of the feature might be suppressed by creating the following environment variable:
```
SUPPRESS_SSH_TUNNEL=true
```

#### Access to Device SSH Public Key

This creates a single-use ssh key pair and retrieves the public key of the key pair. A signed certificate for this public key is then expected as an argument with a subsequent `open_ssh_tunnel` call.

**Direct method: get_ssh_pub_key**

Method Name: `get_ssh_pub_key`

Payload:
```
{
  "tunnel_id": "<uuid identifying the tunnel>",
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statuscode>,
  "payload": {}
}
```
In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {
    "key": "<PEM formatted ssh public key>"
  }
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {}
}
```


#### Opening the SSH tunnel

This creates a ssh tunnel to the bastion host, which can then be used to open an SSH connection to the device. This method therefore starts a SSH reverse tunnel connection to the bastion host and binds it there to a uniquely named socket. The connection to the device can then be established across this socket.

**Note:** The tunnel is maintained open only for 5 minutes, if no connection has been established after this time, it will automatically close.

**Direct method: open_ssh_tunnel**

Method Name: `open_ssh_tunnel`

Payload:
```
{
  "tunnel_id": "<uuid identifying the tunnel>",
  "certificate": "<PEM formatted ssh certificate which the device uses to create the tunnel>"
  "host": "<hostname of the bastion host>"
  "port": "<ssh port on the bastion host>"
  "user": "<ssh user on the bastion host>"
  "socket_path": "<socket path on the bastion host>"
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statuscode>,
  "payload": {}
}
```
In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {}
}
```


#### Closing the SSH tunnel

This closes an existing ssh tunnel. Typically, the ssh tunnel is terminated automatically, once it is not used any longer. This method provides a fallback to cancel an existing connection. This is facilitated by sending control commands to the SSH tunnel master socket.

**Direct method: close_ssh_tunnel**

Method Name: `open_ssh_tunnel`

Payload:
```
{
  "tunnel_id": "<uuid identifying the tunnel>"
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statuscode>,
  "payload": {}
}
```
In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {}
}
```

### Wifi commissioning service

#### Feature availability

The availability of the feature is reported by the following module twin property:
```
"wifi_commissioning":
{
  "version": <ver>
}
```

## Local web service

omnect-device-service provides a http web service that exposes a web API over a unix domain socket.<br>
Information about the socket can be found in the appropriate [socket file](systemd/omnect-device-service.socket)<br>

The web service features is disabled by default and must be explicitly activated via environment variable `WEBSERVICE_ENABLED=true`.

### Trigger reboot

```
curl -X POST --unix-socket /run/omnect-device-service/api.sock http://localhost/reboot/v1
```

### Reload network daemon

```
curl -X POST --unix-socket /run/omnect-device-service/api.sock http://localhost/reload-network/v1
```

### Status updates

omnect-device-service is capable to publish certain properties to a list of defined endpoints. Currently the following properties are published:
- online status: connection status to iothub
- versions: software versions of various components
- timeouts: currently configured [wait-online-timeout](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.html)
- factory-reset: if there was a factory-reset in previous boot, the result is published

#### Publish status

Publishing messages in omnect-device-service is inspired by [centrifugo](https://centrifugal.dev/) and e.g. makes use of it in [omnect-ui](https://github.com/omnect/omnect-ui).

In order to receive updates, a http POST endpoint must be present, where omnect-device-service can post messages to. Interested endpoints must be added to "/etc/omnect/publish_endpoints.json" in the following format (headers are optional):
```
[
  {
    "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/publish",
    "headers": [
      {
        "name": "Content-Type",
        "value": "application/json"
      },
      {
        "name": "X-API-Key",
        "value": "my-api-key"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The publish message format is also inspired by [centrifugo](https://centrifugal.dev/). A message must define a channel and a data attribute, e.g.:
```
{
  "channel": "OnlineStatus",
  "data": {
    "iothub": true
  }
}
```
#### Republish status
The client can trigger omnect-device-service to republish its status:

```
curl -X POST --unix-socket /run/omnect-device-service/api.sock http://localhost/republish/v1
```

#### Get status
It is also possible to query ths current status directly:

```
curl -X GET --unix-socket /run/omnect-device-service/api.sock http://localhost/status/v1
```

## Update validation

On `iot-hub-device-update` update, after flashing the new root partition, we boot into the new root partition and test if the update was successful.<br>
We don't set the new root partition permanently yet. On this boot the startup of `iot-hub-device-update` is prevented and has to be triggered by `omnect-device-service`.<br>
`omnect-device-service` validates if the update was successful. If so, the new root partition is permanently set and the start of `iot-hub-device-update` gets triggered. If not, the device gets rebooted and we boot to the old root partition.<br>
The overall update validation timeout can be overwritten by `UPDATE_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECS` environment variable.

### Criteria for a successful update

The following checks must be passed in order to successfully validate an update:
- system is running
- adu-agent could be started successfully
- omnect-device-service is connected to iot-hub (successfully provisioned)
