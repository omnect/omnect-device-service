# icsdm-device-service

## Instruction
This module is based on the ICS_DeviceManagement [iot-client-template-rs](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/iot-client-template-rs). All information you need to build the project can be found there.


## What is icsdm-device-service
This module implements the device part for the following end to end workflows:
- factory reset
- iot-hub-device-update user consent
- reboot

### Factory reset
The module itself does not perform a factory reset.
It serves as an interface between the cloud and the built-in factory reset from the [ics-dm yocto image](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/meta-ics-dm).

A function was specified for this purpose, a so-called direct method which is described below.

**Direct method: factory reset**

Method Name: `factory_reset`

Payload:
```
{
  "type": <factory reset type number>,
  "restore_settings":
  [
      "wifi"
  ]
}
```

Result:
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statusode>,
  "payload": {"<result>"}
}


The supported reset `type` and the documentation in general can be found in the [meta-ics-dm layer](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/meta-ics-dm#factory-reset).

The **optional** `restore_settings` array can be used to define user settings that must be restored after wiping device storage. Currently only `wifi` settings in `wpa_supplicant.conf` can be restored.

In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status and a meaningful message in the payload:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {"error message"}
}
```

Performing a factory reset also triggers a device restart. The restart time of a device depends on the selected factory reset. After the device has been restarted, this module sends a confirmation to the cloud as reported property in the module twin.

```
"factory_reset_status":
{
    "date": "<UTC time of the factory reset status>",
    "status": "<status>"
}
```

The following status information is defined:
 - "in_progress"
 - "succeeded"
 - "failed"
 - "unexpected factory reset type"


### iot-hub-device-update user consent

In our systems we use the service [iot-hub-device-update](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update) for device firmware update. We have extended this service to include a "user consent" functionality, which allows the user to individually approve a new device update for his IoT device.

The module itself does not perform a user consent. It serves as an interface between the cloud and the built-in user consent from the [ics-dm yocto image](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/meta-ics-dm).

#### Configure general consent

To enable a general consent for all swupdate based firmware updates configure the following general_consent setting in the module twin:

```
"general_consent":
[
  "swupdate"
]
```

To disable the general consent enter the following setting in the module twin:

```
"general_consent":
[

]
```

The current general consent status is also exposed to he cloud as reported property.

#### User consent

If there is no general approval for a firmware update, a separate approval must be given for each upcoming update.
A direct method was specified for this purpose which is described below.

**Direct method: user_consent**

Method Name: `user_consent`

Payload:
```
{
  "swupdate": "<version>"
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statusode>,
  "payload": {"<result>"}
}
```

In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status and a meaningful message in the payload:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {"error message"}
}
```

#### Status user consent

The module reports the status for a required user consent. The module sends for this purpose a request to the cloud as reported property in the module twin.

```
"user_consent_request": [
    {
        "swupdate": "<version>"
    }
]
```

As soon as the consent for a new update has been granted via the direct method "user_consent", this status is reported via the user_consent_history reported property in the module twin.

```
"user_consent_history":
{
  "swupdate":
  [
    "<version>"
  ]
}
```

#### Reboot

A direct method to trigger a device reboot.

**Direct method: reboot**

Method Name: `reboot`

Payload:
```
{
}
```

Result:
```
{
  "status": <HTTP-Statusode>,
  "payload": {}
}
```
In case the method was successful received by the module the return value of the method looks like this:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {}
}
```

In all other cases there will be an error status:
```
{
  "status": 401,
  "payload": {}
}
```
